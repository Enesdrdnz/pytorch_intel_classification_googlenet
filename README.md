i used the googlenet transfer learning model for intel classification data set in kaggle and i realized somethings i have used also resnet101 model and the resnet101 model is 170mb model 
but the googlenet model is 50mb and the accuries is equal so, model selection is very important, you can do same calculation less than half time or more maybe
